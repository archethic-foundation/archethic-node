  Governance pool management.

  The Archethic governance is spread across several pool of voters with different power or area of expertise.

  The pools are:
  - Foundation
  - Technical council
  - Ethical council
  - Uniris
  - Miners
  - Users

  For instance, every code proposal should be supervised and voted according to the technical council.
  Such as miners or users would not have the knowledge required to judge the effectiveness of the proposal.

  Hence, each pool will have dedicated threshold of acceptance regarding the votes for a given proposal.
